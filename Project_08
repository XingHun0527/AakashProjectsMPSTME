ANDROID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
ONLINE ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
I hereby propose the idea of developing an android application for ONLINE  STUDENT ASSESSMENT. The application is developed to save time and display the result as the tests gets over. So no need to wait for the result. It is automatically generated by the server.
	Administrator has a priviledge to create, modify and delete the test papers and its particular questions. User can register, loginand give the test with his specific id, and can see the results as well. This application would will reduce the bulk of paperwork, provide ease of work, flexibility, fast record finding, modifying, adding, removing and generating the reports.
Cost : The cost required in the proposed system is comparatively less to the existing system. 
 Effort : Compared to the existing system the proposed system will provide a better working environment in which their will be ease of work and the effort required will be comparatively less than the existing system. 
 Time: Also the time required generating a report or for doing any other work will be comparatively very less than in the existing system. Record finding and updating will take less time than the existing system. 
 Labor : In the existing system the number of staff required for completing the work is more while the new system will require quite less number of staff.  
CONSTRAINTS
	User interface is only in English i.e. no other language option is available.
